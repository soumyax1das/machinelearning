    "A novel dataset for bankruptcy prediction related to American public companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ is provided. The dataset comprises accounting data from 8,262 distinct companies recorded during the period spanning from 1999 to 2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the Security Exchange Commission (SEC), a company in the American market is deemed bankrupt under two circumstances. Firstly, if the firm's management files for Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, indicating an intention to \"reorganize\" its business. In this case, the company's management continues to oversee day-to-day operations, but significant business decisions necessitate approval from a bankruptcy court. Secondly, if the firm's management files for Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, indicating a complete cessation of operations and the company going out of business entirely.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this dataset, the fiscal year prior to the filing of bankruptcy under either Chapter 11 or Chapter 7 is labeled as \"Bankruptcy\" (1) for the subsequent year. Conversely, if the company does not experience these bankruptcy events, it is considered to be operating normally (0). The dataset is complete, without any missing values, synthetic entries, or imputed added values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting dataset comprises a total of 78,682 observations of firm-year combinations. To facilitate model training and evaluation, the dataset is divided into three subsets based on time periods. The training set consists of data from 1999 to 2011, the validation set comprises data from 2012 to 2014, and the test set encompasses the years 2015 to 2018. The test set serves as a means to assess the predictive capability of models in real-world scenarios involving unseen cases.\n",
